# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 1000 words).


how have you interpreted/explored your chosen theme?

The first time I knew about the ANU Asteroid Mining I laughed a bit, because I thought that would be impossible.
But then... I realised that the most successful advances of humanity seemed to be ridiculous at the beginning,
but after several attempts all those crazy ideas are now a reality, and people now admire all those who dared to
innovate and create new things.


how have you structured the experience (e.g. beginning-middle-end, or something else)?

I wanted to structure my experience using "scenes" which show relevant information about Asteroid Mining, and also
let the user explore the universe by himself / herself. When I created this project, the first thing I programmed was
the opening scene with the p5.gif.js external library, and it seemed pretty cool to me.
After this, I implemented the Asteroid Mining 'learning' sections and the scene with Jupiter, Mars and the mouse
interaction with the asteroids.

what are you trying to make the viewer think?

I want to communicate that Asteroid Mining is possible in the long run, and also want to show how Asteroid mining could
improve our economic and natural resources in the future. Even if the idea seems a bit crazy, I want to communicate that
the idea is not that crazy, and that we can make things happen if we really fight for our dreams.

what are you trying to make the viewer feel?

I want the viewer to feel really amazed and engaged with the elements. I want them to feel like they are capable of
changing the perspective of the planets and the stars. I want them to think: 'Oh wow, this project is so cool. I can
move the planets on the screen'.

what do you hope the viewer tells their friends about your artwork after they leave the gallery?

I want them to remember this project as "the cool 3D interactive project about Asteroid Mining in which you can move the
planets"
